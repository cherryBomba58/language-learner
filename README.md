# language-learner
This app helps learning English.

This link can help you to use ASP.NET Core Web API from WPF.
Because, it would be good if both Angular and WPF projects used the same Web API, which is in the Angular project.
It can be solved by reaching the localhost address of the Angular project from the WPF project as baseUrl.

The localhost address can be found at LanguageLearner.ANG/Properties/launchSettings.json, as the first localhost address.
